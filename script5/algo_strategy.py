'''
Most of the algo code you write will be in this file unless you create new
modules yourself. Start by modifying the 'on_turn' function.

Advanced strategy tips:

Additional functions are made available by importing the AdvancedGameState
class from gamelib/advanced.py as a replcement for the regular GameState class
in game.py.

You can analyze action frames by modifying algocore.py.

The GameState.map object can be manually manipulated to create hypothetical
board states. Though, we recommended making a copy of the map to preserve
the actual current map state.
